# Not so Ez Reversing

It was a reversing challenge in the 0xL4ugh CTF.

It was the least solved reversing chall in the CTF.

In this chall we get a **rar** file **NotEzRE.rar** which has two files inside it **data.dat & rev_challenge**

## Basic Recon
On running file cmd on both the files gives:
1. rev_challenge
```
rev_challenge; ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped
```
So it is a 64 bit ELF binary

2. data.dat
```
data.dat; data
```
It says data because it doesnt recognize the file format.

On looking at its hexdump, we see something strange
```

```

Now here experience comes into play, the start of the file looks like a jpg file but not fully, maybe it is encrypted.

If we compare it with a valid jpg, we can see the similarites

## Analyzing the binary

I mostly prefer static analysis so I opened the file in **binaryninja** & noticed that it's a **C++ binary.**

Now, because I am not very proficient in reversing C++ binaries so I opened **Ghidra** instead to use its decompiler and make my life easier.

On main function we see the following line, which i *guess* opens the data.dat file

```
std::ofstream::basic_ofstream(v14, "data.dat", v3);
```

Then it initializes the seed for PRNG, which will be predictable
```
srand(0);
```

Then it creates an dynamic array
```
std::vector<int>::vector(rand_arr);
```

Then theres a loop,cleaned up the code
```
for ( i = 0; i <= std::vector<unsigned char>::size(data_file) ; ++i )
{
  std::vector<int>::push_back(rand_array, rand() % 4;);
}
```
this runs for data_file size times and generates a pseudo random number, does a modulo by 4 so that the value can be from 0-3 inclusive and stores it into the rand_array

Then after that is another loop which after cleanup is
```
for ( j = 0; j <= std::vector<unsigned char>::size(data_file); ++j )
{
  rand_val = *std::vector<int>::operator[](rand_arr, j);
  data_val = *std::vector<unsigned char>::operator[](data_file, j);
  v8 = std::vector<unsigned char>::operator[](data_file, j);
  *v8 = mystery(data_val, rand_val);
}
```
In this loop, it takes a byte from data_file and rand_arr and calls the mystery function.
The python equivalent of the code would be
```
for i, j in zip(rand_arr, data_file):
  tmp = mystery(i,j)
```

Lets move to the mystery function which little obfuscated, after cleaning it up it is becomes super simple code
```
ulong mystery(uchar data_val,int rand_val)
{
  result = data_val;
  if ( rand_val == 3 )
    return data_val;
  if ( rand_val == 2 )
    // result = mystery(data_val, 0);
    result = data_val ^ 1;
  if ( rand_val == 1 )
    result = data_val;
  if ( rand_val == 0 )
    result = data_val ^ 1;
  return result;
}
```
So all the code does is that it takes the previously generated random value and according to it returns the value.
1. If the rand_val is 1 or 3, then it does nothing and simply returns the original file value
2. If the rand_val is 0 or 2, then it xors the byte with 1

And after that it writes the returned value in the data.dat file and stores it.

So the solution is simple
1. Generate the random values
2. If the rand_val is 1 or 3, write the byte as it is
3. If the rand_val is 0 or 2, xor the byte with 1
4. Write the result into a new file

## Solution

1. First step is to write the program in C to generate the random numbers

The program is as below
```
#include <time.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
int main(void){
  srand(0);
  for(int i=0; i<23469; ++i){ // size of file entered manually
    printf("%i,", rand()%4);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
And redirect the output of the file into a file called **values**

2. Now we have the random values, we just need to implement the logic, I will use a python script for it

```
import subprocess, os
rand_vals = [int(i) for i in open("rand_values").read().split(',')]
fname = "Photo.jpg"

with open("data.dat", "rb") as f:
  fp = f.read()
os.system(f'del {fname}')

o = ''
for i in range(len(fp)):
  tmp = rand_vals[i]
  if tmp == 0 or tmp == 2:
    o += chr(fp[i] ^ 1)
  else:
    o += chr(fp[i])

with open(f"{fname}", 'wb') as f:
  f.write(o.encode('charmap'))

```

After executing this file, we should get our flag file, but when I tried to open the "Photo.jpg", it was still encrypted.

At this point I was totally stuck, because the script was fine, the implemented logic was fine, but still I didnt get the flag.

Then after like 10 hours I got an idea.

Again running the file command on the binary we got
```
rev_challenge; ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped
```
So the file is **Linux binary** and I was running the decrypt file on **Windows**. So I ran the decryption script on Linux and it worked correctly and I got the flag.

```
flag: 0xL4ugh{th4t_w4z_not_so_eazzzy_but_you_did_it}
```

But theoretically it should be the same on both Linux and Windows so what was the problem.

After digging more, it turns out that the problem was in the C program which generates the random numbers. It turns out that the ```rand()``` function works different under Linux and Windows, and I was running the script on Windows, so I was getting different random numbers

I posted both random values which are generated on [Windows](https://github.com/DaBaddest/CTF-Writeups/blob/master/0xL4ugh%202021/Not%20so%20Ez%20Reversing/values_win) and [Linux](https://github.com/DaBaddest/CTF-Writeups/blob/master/0xL4ugh%202021/Not%20so%20Ez%20Reversing/values_linux) and we can clearly see the difference in random numbers.
