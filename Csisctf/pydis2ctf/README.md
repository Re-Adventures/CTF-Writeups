# pydis2ctf

pydis2ctf was in the reversing catogory.

We get three files:
1. C1cipher.txt
2. C2cipher.txt
3. encodedflag.txt

Both C1cipher.txt and C2cipher.txt were python disassembly and encodedflag.txt contains the encoded flag.

For reversing python bytecode you will require [this](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html)

Reversing and reimplementing the first file was enough to solve the task

But I reverse engineered both the files which are present [here](https://github.com/DaBaddest/CTF-Writeups/blob/master/Csisctf/pydis2ctf/C1cipher.py) and [here](https://github.com/DaBaddest/CTF-Writeups/blob/master/Csisctf/pydis2ctf/C2cipher.py)

*I reverse engineered the [second file](https://github.com/DaBaddest/CTF-Writeups/blob/master/Csisctf/pydis2ctf/Reversed%20C2cipher.py) too but I reimplemented only the first one.*

My approach for reversing the first file:
```
  2           0 LOAD_CONST               1 ('')
              2 STORE_FAST               1 (ret_text)     # ret_text = ''

  3           4 LOAD_GLOBAL              0 (list)
              6 LOAD_FAST                0 (text)         ## list(text)
              8 CALL_FUNCTION            1
             10 GET_ITER
        >>   12 FOR_ITER                42 (to 56)
             14 STORE_FAST               2 (i)            # for i in list(text):

  4          16 LOAD_FAST                0 (text)
             18 LOAD_METHOD              1 (count)
             20 LOAD_FAST                2 (i)
             22 CALL_METHOD              1
             24 STORE_FAST               3 (counter)      # counter = count(i)

  5          26 LOAD_FAST                1 (ret_text)
             28 LOAD_GLOBAL              2 (chr)
             30 LOAD_CONST               2 (2)           
             32 LOAD_GLOBAL              3 (ord)
             34 LOAD_FAST                2 (i)
             36 CALL_FUNCTION            1                ## ord(i) * 2
             38 BINARY_MULTIPLY
             40 LOAD_GLOBAL              4 (len)
             42 LOAD_FAST                0 (text)
             44 CALL_FUNCTION            1                ## len(text)
             46 BINARY_SUBTRACT                           ## (ord(i) * 2) - len(text)
             48 CALL_FUNCTION            1                ## chr((ord(i) * 2) - len(text))
             50 INPLACE_ADD
             52 STORE_FAST               1 (ret_text)     # ret_text += chr((ord(i) * 2) - len(text))
             54 JUMP_ABSOLUTE           12

  6     >>   56 LOAD_FAST                1 (ret_text)
             58 RETURN_VALUE
```
Where # means it is still on the stack,
And ## means that it was earlier on the stack and it is used now.

So the Original program is:
```
ret_text = ''

for i in text:
  counter = text.count(i)
  ret_text += chr((2 * ord(i)) - len(text))

```

We just need to reverse it.

The whole solution script is:
```
text = '¤Ä°¤ÆªÔ\x86$\xa04\x9cÌ`H\x9c¬>¼f\x9c¦@HH\xa0\x84¨\x9a\x9a¢vÐØ'
ret_text = ''
for i in list(text):
  ret_text += chr((ord(i) + len(text))//2)
print(ret_text)
```

which gives us the flag:
```
csictf{T#a+_wA5_g0oD_d155aSe^^bLy}
```
